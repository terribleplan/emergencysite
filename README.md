##News
###Aug 18 2013
An update including a working MySQL (PDO) implementation is in the works and should be
pushed as early as tomorrow. (This update will not include an admin interface or a
submission interface, that will take a bit more testing. It will allow you to use
something like PHPMyAdmin to edit entries)
